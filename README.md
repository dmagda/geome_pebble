GeoMe service implementation for Pebble smartwatch.

GeoMe on Pebble will let you share your location with friends or relatives instantly from your watch. There is no need to get your phone out if someone asks where you are!


In general, GeoMe is a geolocation platform that lets exchange whereabouts quickly and watch a man or an object movement on a map in real-time. 

On top of the platform the company built: 

1) an app of the same name that helps people to share their location with others or ask friends or relatives for their whereabouts with a single click; 

2) solution for companies that have their own delivery service. The solution lets a company's customers track goods/food delivery in real-time from any Internet-enabled device they have.
